## Account Manager React App

This is a small React (Vite) application that lets users **register**, **log in**, and **view/edit** their account information.

The app is intentionally simple and uses **client-side storage** (localStorage) instead of a real backend, which makes it easy to run and review for the purposes of this test.

### Features

- **Registration page**
  - Create a new account with name, email, and password.
  - Real-time password strength indicator (Weak, Medium, Strong) with visual progress bar.
  - Password visibility toggle button to show/hide passwords.
  - Real-time form validation with error messages.
  - Password confirmation field with match indicator.
  - Prevents duplicate accounts for the same email.

- **Login page**
  - Log in with email and password.
  - Shows clear error messages for missing fields and invalid credentials.
  - Password visibility toggle button.
  - "Forgot Password?" link positioned above the sign-in button.

- **Forgot Password feature**
  - Two-step password reset process:
    1. Enter registered email address
    2. Enter new password with real-time strength indicator
  - Password strength feedback (Weak, Medium, Strong) with visual progress bar.
  - Password visibility toggle in reset form.
  - Success/error messages for each step.
  - Updates stored password and allows immediate login with new credentials.

- **Account page**
  - View and edit your name and email.
  - Optionally change your password.
  - Validates required fields and checks for duplicate email addresses.

- **Session handling**
  - Logged-in user and list of registered users are stored in `localStorage`.
  - Session persists across browser refresh until you log out.
  - Automatic session refresh after password reset.

- **Navigation and styling**
  - Navigation bar showing login/register links or current user + logout button.
  - Uses **React Router** for page navigation.
  - Uses **Bootstrap** (latest 5.x) for simple, clean styling.
  - Icon buttons using Bootstrap Icons (bi-icons) for visibility toggles.

### Technology Stack

- **React** (Vite, React 18+/19+ compatible)
- **React Router** for routing
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling
- **Bootstrap Icons** for icon components
- **localStorage** for simple client-side data persistence

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then open the printed URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Deployment

#### Deploy to GitHub

1. **Initialize a Git repository** (if not already done)

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add all files to staging**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Create your first commit**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Account Manager React App"
   ```

4. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
   - Enter repository name (e.g., `account-manager`)
   - Choose Public or Private
   - Click "Create repository"

5. **Add remote and push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your GitHub credentials.

#### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Option A: Deploy from CLI**

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   Follow the prompts to:
   - Confirm project details
   - Select production environment
   - Deploy

3. **Option B: Deploy from Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub account
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Configure project settings (keep defaults for Vite)
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Automatic Deployments**
   - Every push to `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment
   - Vercel will build and deploy your app automatically

5. **Access your deployed app**
   - Your app will be available at `https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app`
   - Check your Vercel dashboard for the live URL

#### Vercel Configuration (Optional)

Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory for SPA routing support:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails on Vercel | Ensure `npm run build` works locally. Check all dependencies are in `package.json`. |
| Blank page or 404 errors | Add `vercel.json` with rewrites (see config above) to handle React Router SPA routing. |
| localStorage not working | localStorage is fully supported. Data persists only in the user's browser. |

**Project Status for Deployment:**
- ✅ All dependencies properly defined
- ✅ Vite build configuration correct
- ✅ React Router properly configured
- ✅ No known Vercel deployment issues
- ⚠️ Consider adding `vercel.json` for better SPA routing
