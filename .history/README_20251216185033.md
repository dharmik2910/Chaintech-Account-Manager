## Account Manager React App

This is a small React (Vite) application that lets users **register**, **log in**, and **view/edit** their account information.

The app is intentionally simple and uses **client-side storage** (localStorage) instead of a real backend, which makes it easy to run and review for the purposes of this test.

### Features

- **Registration page**
  - Create a new account with name, email, and password.
  - Basic validation (required fields, password length, matching confirmation).
  - Prevents duplicate accounts for the same email.

- **Login page**
  - Log in with email and password.
  - Shows clear error messages for missing fields and invalid credentials.

- **Account page**
  - View and edit your name and email.
  - Optionally change your password.
  - Validates required fields and checks for duplicate email addresses.

- **Session handling**
  - Logged-in user and list of registered users are stored in `localStorage`.
  - Session persists across browser refresh until you log out.

- **Navigation and styling**
  - Navigation bar showing login/register links or current user + logout button.
  - Uses **React Router** for page navigation.
  - Uses **Bootstrap** (latest 5.x) for simple, clean styling.

### Technology Stack

- **React** (Vite, React 18+/19+ compatible)
- **React Router** for routing
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling
- **localStorage** for simple client-side data persistence

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then open the printed URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### How It Works (High Level)

- `AuthContext.jsx` keeps track of:
  - The list of registered users.
  - The currently logged-in user.
  - Helper functions to register, log in, log out, and update the current user.
- Authentication data is **not secure** and is only meant for demo/testing purposes:
  - Passwords are stored as plain text in `localStorage`.
  - There is no server-side validation or protection.
- `App.jsx` defines:
  - A top-level layout with a Bootstrap navbar.
  - Routes for `/login`, `/register`, and `/account`.
  - A simple `PrivateRoute` component that only allows access to `/account` when a user is logged in.

### Notes and Assumptions

- The app is designed as a **front-end only** demo. In a real project, all account data and authentication would be handled by a secure backend.
- Error messages are intentionally straightforward and user-friendly to make behavior clear.
- The code avoids unnecessary complexity and includes comments where behavior might not be obvious.
